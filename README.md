# Socket Ship

Socket ship is a multi-player shoot-em-up. Guide your ship through the void, blasting enemy ships with your lasers.

It's called Socket Ship as it's a technology test that uses WebSockets to communicate with a server to host the multiplayer action.

## Details for the first planned release

* Each new player that joins will be given a different colour
* There is no end, except when the server dies
* Once the server is running, the game has essentailly begun
* When players join they'll be able to start moving immediately
* No collision detection between ships (they just pass over/under each other)
